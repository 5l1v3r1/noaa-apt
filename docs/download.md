## Download

There is a GUI version and a no-GUI version available.

You can download executables for GNU/Linux or Windows from the
[releases page](https://github.com/martinber/noaa-apt/releases). Your options
are:

- GNU/Linux:

    - Download the latest version with GUI, (needs GTK and GLIBC version at least
      2.19).

    - Download the latest version without GUI.

    - [Compile it yourself](./development.html#compilation).

- Windows:

    - Download the latest version. Has GUI.

    - [Compile the GUI version yourself from GNU/Linux](./development.html#compilation).

    - Compile the no-gui version, or compile from Windows but I don't know how to
      do it.

- OSX:

  - [Compile it yourself](./development.html#compilation).

- Something else?

    - At least the no-gui version should work everywhere (Raspberry Pi?) because
      there are no dependencies apart from GTK and a handful of pure Rust
      modules.
      [You should compile it yourself though](./development.html#compilation).
