<p>
	Here I will explain an overview of not only how to receive images from NOAA
	satellites, but also about how it works because I found the whole process
	interesting. If you only want to receive the images, check out the

<h1>Why NOAA satellites</h1>
<p>
	The easiest satellites to receive images from are some NOAA satellites from
	the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_Operational_Environmental_Satellites">POES constellation</a>,
	we are interested on NOAA 15, NOAA 18 and NOAA 19. From now on I'm going to
	call them NOAA satellites like everyone but we can only receive three of them,
	that's because they use "old technology", we do not need expensive equipment.

<p>
  Some facts about these NOAA satellites:

	<figcaption>
		Example of orbits of the three satellites as predicted by gpredict. The
		yellow circle around each satellite shows roughly where the satellite can be
		received, if you are exactly on the circumference you can see the satellite
		exactly on the horizon. The red line shows the path for the next orbits,
		eventually each one of them can be received anywhere on Earth.

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			They have a low orbit, at about 800km above the surface of the Earth,
			really low compared to geostationary satellites at 35,786km. Because of
			this the satellites move quite fast and are
			<em>available above the horizon only for 10 minutes and go away</em>.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			The orbit is polar, this means that they go from north to south or from
			south to north. Also means that
			<em>they can cover all the surface of the Earth eventually</em>.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			The satellites have no memory, they send the images at realtime. 
			<em>they can cover all the surface of the Earth eventually</em>.
